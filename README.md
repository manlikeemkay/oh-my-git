# Introduction

Welcome to my super useful collection of all things GIT.

These are commands and scripts that I've collected over years of using GIT when I've found myself in situations I don't quite know how to get out of.

### 1. Delete a remote tag

```
git push --delete origin tagname
```

### 2. Overwrite GIT commiter and author information

In your terminal window enter the following and update the `OLD_EMAIL`, `CORRECT_NAME` and `CORRECT_EMAIL` values.

```
#!/bin/sh

git filter-branch -f --env-filter '

OLD_EMAIL="your-old-email@example.com"
CORRECT_NAME="Your Correct Name"
CORRECT_EMAIL="your-correct-email@example.com"

if [ "$GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL" = "$OLD_EMAIL" ]
then
export GIT_COMMITTER_NAME="$CORRECT_NAME"
export GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL="$CORRECT_EMAIL"
fi

if [ "$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL" = "$OLD_EMAIL" ]
then
export GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="$CORRECT_NAME"
export GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="$CORRECT_EMAIL"
fi

' --tag-name-filter cat -- --branches --tags
```

Once complete, check your git history and if you're happy run

```
git push --force --tags origin 'refs/heads/*'
```

### 3. Move uncommitted changes from current branch to another branch

```
git stash
git checkout my-branch
git stash pop
```

## üí° Contributing
